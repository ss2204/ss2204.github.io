  <p>Designer Lauren Hallden developed the Online Dating Ipsum to generate the “word salad” that she says populates online dating profiles. I’ve never tried online dating, but I’ve read enough horror stories to assume that after a while all the profiles look alike. Something like this:

    Introvert jazz cafes having a few beers self-deprecating humor. Degree in philosophy Vampire Weekend introvert self-deprecating humor really hoppy beers, grilling tacos really hoppy beers medical school I'm looking for. Family is very important to me bikes trying this for the first time Breaking Bad I'm really good at bored at home.
    
    This might be useful for writing your own profile, in case you have no idea what to tell people about yourself.</p>
  <p>The generator has dispensed with mere verbs and connective words and focuses on nouns. For example:

    hotdog systema plastic tanto concrete car refrigerator kanji physical sprawl geodesic singularity kanji. gang franchise pen cartel monofilament network tank-traps tiger-team pen wonton soup tanto motion drone. footage film drugs -ware Shibuya futurity hotdog systemic youtube Legba motion assault vinyl. sensory nodal point Chiba long-chain hydrocarbons refrigerator cyber- sensory footage neural cartel fluidity faded tanto.</p>
